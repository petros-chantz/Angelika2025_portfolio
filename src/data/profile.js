  biography: `Alexandra Müller is a Swiss architect whose work explores the intersection of materiality, light, and landscape. After completing her studies at ETH Zurich, she gained experience at leading European practices before establishing her own studio in 2015.

Her approach to architecture is grounded in a deep respect for context—both physical and cultural. Each project begins with careful observation of the site, the local building traditions, and the needs of the people who will inhabit the space. This process of inquiry leads to designs that feel both inevitable and surprising.

The studio's work spans scales from intimate private residences to significant cultural institutions, united by a commitment to craft and spatial quality. Projects have been recognized with numerous awards, including the Swiss Architecture Award and the European Prize for Contemporary Architecture.

Alexandra teaches design studios at ETH Zurich and lectures internationally on topics relating to sustainable construction and the role of architecture in civic life.`,
  philosophy: `Architecture, at its best, creates the conditions for life to unfold. It provides shelter and comfort, but also wonder and delight. I believe that buildings should be rooted in their place—responsive to climate, culture, and community—while remaining open to transformation over time.

Every project is an opportunity to ask fundamental questions: How do we want to live? What do we value? How can built form contribute to human flourishing and ecological balance? These questions guide our work, leading to spaces that are at once practical and poetic.`,
